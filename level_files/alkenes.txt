In organic chemistry, an alkene, olefin, or olefine is an unsaturated chemical
compound containing at least one carbon-to-carbon double bond. The simplest
alkenes, with only one double bond, no rings, and no other functional groups,
are hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n.

Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and
properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.

The double bond in the middle makes them more reactive because the molecule is
not saturated. An alkene's unsaturation means that it will take the color out of
bromine. The names of alkenes always end with -ene.

LIST OF ALKENES
================================================================================
The following is a list of the first seventeen Alkenes:
 - Ethene (C2H4)
 - Propene (C3H6)
 - Butene (C4H8)
 - Pentene (C5H10)
 - Hexene (C6H12)
 - Heptene (C7H14)
 - Octene (C8H16)
 - Nonene (C9H18)
 - Decene (C10H20)
 - Undecene (C11H22)
 - Dodecene (C12H24)
 - Tridecene (C13H26)
 - Tetradecene (C14H28)
 - Pentadecene (C15H30)
 - Hexadecene (C16H32)
 - Heptadecene (C17H34)

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
================================================================================
The physical properties of alkenes are comparable with those of alkanes. The
main differences between the two are that the acidity levels of alkenes are much
higher than the ones in alkanes. The physical state depends on molecular mass
(gases from ethene to butene - liquids from pentene onwards). The simplest
alkenes, ethene, propene and butene are gases. Linear alkenes of approximately
five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids.

FUEL
================================================================================
Alkenes are not used as fuels because:
 - They are scarce in nature. They are made from other hydrocarbons to make
   plastics, antiâ€“freeze and many other useful compounds.
 - They burn with a smoky flame due to less efficient, and more polluting
   incomplete combustion, so the heat energy release is lower than for alkanes.
