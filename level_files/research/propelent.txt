SOLID PROPELLANT
================================================================================

- Composite propellants made from a solid oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate
  or ammonium nitrate, a synthetic rubber such as HTPB, PBAN, or Polyurethane
  (or energetic polymers such as polyglycidyl nitrate or polyvinyl nitrate for
  extra energy), optional high-explosive fuels (again, for extra energy) such as
  RDX or nitroglycerin, and usually a powdered metal fuel such as aluminum.
- Some amateur propellants use potassium nitrate, combined with sugar, epoxy, or
  other fuels and binder compounds.
- Potassium perchlorate has been used as an oxidizer, paired with asphalt,
  epoxy, and other binders.

Propellants that explode in operation are of little practical use currently,
although there have been experiments with Pulse Detonation Engines. Also the
newly synthesized bishomocubane based compounds are under consideration in the
research stage as both solid and liquid propellants of the future.

GRAIN
=====
Solid propellants are used in forms called grains. A grain is any individual
particle of propellant regardless of the size or shape. The shape and size of a
propellant grain determines the burn time, amount of gas, and rate produced from
the burning propellant and, as a consequence, thrust vs time profile.

There are three types of burns that can be achieved with different grains.

Progressive burn: Usually a grain with multiple perforations or a star cut in
                  the center providing a lot of surface area.
Degressive burn: Usually a solid grain in the shape of a cylinder or sphere.
Neutral burn: Usually a single perforation; as outside surface decreases the
              inside surface increases at the same rate.

COMPOSITION
===========
There are four different types of solid propellant compositions:

Single-based propellant: A single based propellant has nitrocellulose as its
                         chief explosives ingredient. Stabilizers and other
                         additives are used to control the chemical stability
                         and enhance the propellantâ€™s properties.
Double-based propellant: Double-based propellants consist of nitrocellulose with
                         nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate
                         explosives added. Stabilizers and other additives are
                         also used. Nitroglycerin reduces smoke and increases
                         the energy output. Double-based propellants are used in
                         small arms, cannons, mortars and rockets.
Triple-based propellant: Triple-based propellants consist of nitrocellulose,
                         nitroguanidine, nitroglycerin or other liquid organic
                         nitrate explosives. Triple-based propellants are used
                         in cannons.
Composite: Composites contain do not utilize nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin,
           nitroguanidine or any other organic nitrate as the primary
           constituent. Composites usually consist of a fuel such as metallic
           aluminum, a combustible binder such as synthetic rubber or HTPB, and
           an oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate. Composite propellants are
           used in large rocket motors. In unique applications, such as the US
           SLBM Trident II missile, nitroglycerin is added to the aluminum and
           ammonium perchlorate composite as an energetic plasticizer.

LIQUID PROPELLANT
================================================================================

In rockets, three main liquid bipropellant combinations are used: cryogenic
oxygen and hydrogen, cryogenic oxygen and a hydrocarbon, and storable
propellants.

Cryogenic oxygen-hydrogen combination system: Used in upper stages and sometimes
                                              in booster stages of space launch
                                              systems.This is a nontoxic
                                              combination. This gives high
                                              specific impulse and is ideal for
                                              high-velocity missions
Cryogenic oxygen-hydrocarbon propellant system: Used for many booster stages of
                                                space launch vehicles as well as
                                                a smaller number of second
                                                stages. This combination of
                                                fuel/oxidizer has high density
                                                and hence allows for a more
                                                compact booster design.
Storable propellant combinations: Used in almost all bipropellant low-thrust,
                                  auxiliary or reaction control rocket engines,
                                  as well as in some in large rocket engines for
                                  first and second stages of ballistic missiles.
                                  They are instant-starting and suitable for
                                  long-term storage.

Propellant combinations used for liquid propellant rockets include:
 - Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen
 - Liquid oxygen and kerosene or RP-1
