Prof. Lewis has been interested in nuclear power for years and he has finally
decided to make a nuclear reactor in his shed. He's a bit rough around the edges
on his chemistry knowledge so he has been learning the GCSE chemistry syllabus.

Prof. Lewis wrote some notes about alkenes but he has lost them on the computer.
He definitely knows that the file is called alkenes.txt but he doesn't know
which folder. Can you find the *FULL* path to the alkenes.txt file?

(hint: you will need to use the find command and make sure you search the
*entire* computer)
