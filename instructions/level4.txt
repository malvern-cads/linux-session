Farmer Joe shares a computer with his son who is a scientist for the government.
He keeps all of his research in a folder /root/research.

While Farmer Joe is cleaning up some old files he comes across a hidden file in
his son's research folder. It seems pretty important so he talks to his son
about it, but unfortunately he has forgotten what was inside the file. Can you
find out what the secret inside the file is?
