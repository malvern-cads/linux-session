Farmer Joe uses this computer keep track of all of the animals on his farm.
Unfortunately, he's forgotten the commands for reading the names inside his
animal files.

There is a folder called animals in your home folder. What are the names of the
two animals inside that folder?

(hint: you will need to use cd, ls and cat for this level)
