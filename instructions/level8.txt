Prof. Lewis needs to take his research to work but he doesn't have enough space
on his favourite Spiderman flash drive to store it all. He needs propellant.txt,
thermodynamics.txt and alkenes.txt. He thinks that you might be able to compress
them into a zip file in order for it to fit on his flash drive.

1. Can you copy alkenes.txt from the folder from the last level to
   /root/research?

2. Can you compress the three files into a single zip file?
   (hint: you will need the zip command)
